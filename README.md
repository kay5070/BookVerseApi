# BookVerse API

A RESTful API for an online bookstore built with ASP.NET Core 8. Includes JWT authentication, role-based authorization, and Stripe payment integration.

## About

This is a backend system I built for managing an online bookstore. The architecture follows clean architecture principles - using repository pattern, unit of work, dependency injection, all that good stuff. I wanted something that wouldn't turn into a mess as it grows, so I spent some time getting the foundation right.

The project handles everything you'd expect from a bookstore API: user accounts, browsing books, managing inventory, and processing payments through Stripe. It's fairly complete but there's always room for improvement.

## What it does

**User Authentication**
- JWT tokens with refresh token support
- Role-based permissions (Admin and User roles)
- Password hashing through ASP.NET Core Identity
- Password reset via email
- Token refresh when they expire

**Managing Books**
- Full CRUD for books, authors, and categories
- Search and filtering (by price, author, category, publication date)
- Pagination because nobody wants to load 10,000 books at once
- Books can have multiple authors and categories (many-to-many relationships)
- Stock tracking for inventory management

**Payments**
- Stripe integration for handling payments
- Order creation and tracking
- Payment status updates
- Stock automatically decreases when orders go through
- Users can view their order history

**Architecture stuff**
- Clean Architecture (Core, Application, Infrastructure, API layers)
- Repository Pattern for data access
- Unit of Work for managing transactions
- AutoMapper for DTOs
- Entity Framework Core with Code First migrations

## Tech Stack

Built with:
- ASP.NET Core 8.0
- C# 12.0
- SQL Server with Entity Framework Core
- JWT Bearer tokens + ASP.NET Core Identity
- Stripe API
- Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation
- AutoMapper

```

Pretty standard clean architecture setup. Core has no dependencies, Application depends on Core, Infrastructure implements interfaces from Core/Application, and the API layer ties everything together.

## Getting it Running

### What you need

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- SQL Server (Express works fine if you don't have the full version)
- A Stripe account (free test account works)
- Git

### Setup Instructions

First, clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bookverse-api.git
cd bookverse-api
```

Now for the configuration. I'm using user secrets for sensitive data instead of putting it in appsettings.json (please don't commit your secrets to GitHub):

```bash
cd BookVerseApi
dotnet user-secrets init

# Database connection - adjust this for your SQL Server setup
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "Server=.;Database=BookVerseDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"

# JWT settings - make sure the secret is at least 32 characters
dotnet user-secrets set "JwtOptions:Secret" "your-super-secret-key-min-32-characters-long"
dotnet user-secrets set "JwtOptions:Issuer" "BookVerseApi"
dotnet user-secrets set "JwtOptions:Audience" "BookVerseClient"
dotnet user-secrets set "JwtOptions:ExpirationTimeInMinutes" "60"

# Default admin user - change these before deploying to production
dotnet user-secrets set "AdminUser:Email" "admin@bookverse.com"
dotnet user-secrets set "AdminUser:Password" "Admin@123456"
dotnet user-secrets set "AdminUser:FirstName" "Admin"
dotnet user-secrets set "AdminUser:LastName" "User"

# Stripe keys - get these from your Stripe dashboard
dotnet user-secrets set "Stripe:PublishableKey" "pk_test_your_key"
dotnet user-secrets set "Stripe:SecretKey" "sk_test_your_key"

# Email settings (optional, only needed for password resets)
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailOptions:SmtpHost" "smtp.gmail.com"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailOptions:SmtpPort" "587"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailOptions:SmtpUsername" "your-email@gmail.com"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailOptions:SmtpPassword" "your-app-password"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailOptions:FromEmail" "noreply@bookverse.com"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailOptions:FromName" "BookVerse"
```

Note: If you're using Gmail for SMTP, you'll need to generate an app password. Regular password won't work with 2FA enabled.

Run the migrations to create the database:
```bash
dotnet ef database update --project ../BookVerse.Infrastructure --startup-project .
```

If that command fails, make sure you have the EF Core tools installed:
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

Start the application:
```bash
dotnet run
```

The API should start up at `https://localhost:7xxx/` (the port might be different). Navigate there and you'll see the Swagger UI with all the endpoints.

## API Reference

Here's what's available. Most GET endpoints don't require authentication, but POST/PUT/DELETE usually do.

- `POST /api/admin/users/{id}/remove-admin` - Remove admin role from user
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}` - Delete a user account

## Query Parameters

Most list endpoints support these query parameters. Mix and match as needed:

**Pagination:**
```
?pageNumber=1&pageSize=10
```
Default page size is 10, but you can adjust it. I'd recommend keeping it under 100 to avoid performance issues.

**Sorting:**
```
?sortBy=Title&sortDescending=false
```
You can sort by most properties. Check the Swagger docs to see what's available for each endpoint.

**Searching:**
```
?searchTerm=harry+potter
```
Searches across relevant fields (title, description, etc.)

**Filtering (Books):**
```
?minPrice=10&maxPrice=50&authorId=1&categoryId=2&publishedAfter=2020-01-01
```
All filters are optional. Combine them however you want.

## Example Usage

Here are some common request examples. Check Swagger for the complete schemas.

**Register a new user:**
```json
POST /api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "Password@123",
  "role": 1
}
```

The password needs to meet the default Identity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number, special char). Role 1 is User, role 2 is Admin.

**Login:**
```json
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "Password@123"
}
```

This returns an access token and a refresh token. Store both securely (not in localStorage if you can help it).

**Create an order:**
```json
POST /api/order
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "items": [
    {
      "bookId": 1,
      "quantity": 2
    },
    {
      "bookId": 3,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

The order total gets calculated server-side based on current book prices. After creating the order, use the payment endpoint to actually charge the customer.

**Add a book (admin only):**
```json
POST /api/book
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Clean Code",
  "description": "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
  "isbn": "9780132350884",
  "price": 42.99,
  "publishDate": "2008-08-01",
  "quantityInStock": 50,
  "authorIds": [1],
  "categoryIds": [2, 5]
}
```

Make sure the author and category IDs actually exist, or you'll get a validation error.

## Security Notes

I've tried to implement security best practices:

- Passwords are hashed using ASP.NET Core Identity (never stored in plain text)
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Refresh tokens stored separately (you could move these to Redis in production)
- Role-based authorization throughout
- CORS properly configured
- HTTPS enforced
- Security headers middleware
- Input validation on all DTOs
- EF Core uses parameterized queries (no SQL injection risk)
- XSS protection enabled

That said, if you're deploying this to production, you should probably get a security review. I'm not a security expert.

## Database Structure

The database uses ASP.NET Identity tables for user management. On top of that:

Main tables:
- **Users** - from ASP.NET Identity
- **Books** - book catalog
- **Authors** - author information
- **Categories** - book categories
- **Orders** - customer orders
- **OrderItems** - individual items in orders

Junction tables for many-to-many:
- **BookAuthors** - links books to authors
- **BookCategories** - links books to categories

Pretty straightforward normalized schema. EF Core handles the joins.
